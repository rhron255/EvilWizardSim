/**
 * The theme constraints, asserted rather than reviewed.
 *
 * Issue #15 knowingly overrides CLAUDE.md rule 3, and the six constraints it
 * traded for that override are only worth anything if they are measured. Each
 * describe block below is one of them.
 *
 * Two anchoring notes, both CLAUDE.md failure mode 11:
 *
 *   - The CSS sweep reads `tokens.css` OFF DISK. The stylesheet is a separate
 *     hand-written artifact that `themes.ts` does not generate, so it is a
 *     real independent anchor — a theme added to the TS and forgotten in the
 *     CSS (or vice versa) fails here rather than rendering half-applied.
 *   - The contrast floor is computed from the DEFAULT palette, not pinned to a
 *     literal. Widening the default's own contrast would move the floor with
 *     it, which is correct; hardcoding 13.8 would let a future edit to the
 *     default silently strand every theme above it.
